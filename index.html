        <p>We have made new accomadations to our menu to satisfy our costumers that are on a strict vegan diet.  We have added four meals to our menu that are strictly vegan meals. Although there are not many vegan costumers, the ones we get enjoy the meals a alot and we often see them on a daily basis, because you dint typically see vegan meals on many menus. If you are vegan or want to try our new vegan meals come dine at The Fix today!</p>

        <p>Our head chef Heidi was hand picked out of many highly qualified chefs because not only did she study culunary in school but she is also a qualified dietition. She was picked because she brought many good dishes to us that fit a bunch of dietary needs and we realized it would be greatly appriecated by our customers and allow us to bring in a bigger variety of guests. All of the dishes geared to dietary needs were created by her, and every single one of them is a hit!</p>
